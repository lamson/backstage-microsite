            <Block.Paragraph>
              All of Spotify’s services are automatically indexed in Backstage. So our engineers can stop playing detective — no more spamming Slack channels asking if anyone knows who owns a particular service and where you can find its API, only to discover that the owner went on sabbatical three months ago and you have to hunt them down on a mountain in Tibet where they’re on a 12-day silent meditation retreat. At Spotify, anyone can always find anyone else’s service, inspect its APIs, and contact its current owner — all with one search.

          <Block.Paragraph>We manage a lot of data pipelines (also known as workflows) here at Spotify. So, of course, we made a great workflows plugin for our version of Backstage. All our workflow tools — including a scheduler, log inspector, data lineage graph, and configurable alerts — are integrated into one simple interface.</Block.Paragraph>

            <Block.Paragraph>You’re a Spotify engineer about to build a new microservice (or any component) using Spring Boot. Where do you start? Search for a quick start guide online? Create an empty repo on GitHub? Copy and paste an old project? Nope. Just go to Backstage, and you’ll be up and running in two minutes — with a “Hello World” app, CI, and documentation all automatically set up and configured in a standardized way.</Block.Paragraph>
